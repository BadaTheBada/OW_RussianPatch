Senet players are well advised to keep away from the House of Water, or else they have to restart at the House of Rebirth!:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ROME:The game's name is ludus latrunculorum, or latrones for short - the game of brigands. The players agree on a number of pieces, such as 16 or 24, to place on an 8x8 board. They place their pieces on the board on alternate turns, finally placing the Dux - a leader piece. Once all the pieces are in place, the players move their pieces so as to catch opposing pieces between two of their own, thus capturing the enemy piece. Latrones has gained particular appreciation among young men and women looking to hone their skills as tacticians.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_BABYLONIA:It's a two player game called the Game of Twenty Squares. The game is played on a board where two large rectangular areas are joined by a narrow "bridge". Both players have seven pieces, gradually placed on the board , and throw a four-sided die to determine the allowed moves. Players race to remove their own pieces by getting them to the other end of the board while trying to capture opposing pieces to impede their opponent's progress.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ASSYRIA:Nobody seems to know for sure whether the game is a local invention or was brought by traders from abroad. Whatever the case may be, it goes by "game of fifty eight holes", derived from the setup of the game board, which has two sets of twenty nine holes. One player has five sticks with dog heads while the other has five with jackal heads. The objective of the game is to gradually move your sticks past the opponent's to a point at the end of the board.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_PERSIA:The game is known as nardashir, or nard for short. Each player has multiple ivory pieces, which are moved between triangles on the game board, with a throw of two dice determining the possible moves. Lone pieces may be captured by the opponent, while triangles with two or more pieces are invulnerable. Players race to the opposite end of the board while also attacking each other's pieces. In addition to being a tense game itself, nard has also attracted attention from gamblers.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_CARTHAGE:Rumor has it, the game is a variant of another game played in far-off lands, though nobody knows for sure. Whatever the origin, the game is remarkably simple, needing nothing more than a series of holes and some seeds or stones to be played. Players place their seeds in pits, as if sowing. On each turn, the players rearrange their seeds across other pits, trying to capture some of the opponent's seeds in the process. The winner of this game can claim to be a more accomplished planner and landowner.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_GREECE:The people call this game petteia, and have come to consider it a test of wits and strategy. Two players face off on a rectangular board, one controls white pieces and the other one black. Players attempt to surround the opponent's pieces to capture them, and ultimately to leave their opponent with no moves to make. Petteia players say that a struggle in this game is just like watching opposing phalanxes face off on a battlefield.:}

    <Translation>It seems like yesterday that {CHARACTER-1} was a baby, but time has flown and {G1:he:she} is almost a grown {G1:man:woman} now. As is {RELIGION-3,1} custom, a {G1:bar:bat} mitzvah ceremony should be held for {CHARACTER-SHORT-1}.

There's no doubt that {CHARACTER-SHORT-1} will make you proud with {G1:his:her} {p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_HIGH_WISDOM:wisdom:many talents}. How can we best make the {G1:bar:bat} mitzvah further our needs?</Translation>

    <Translation>A group of grizzled soldiers approach one of our outposts, offering their allegiance. They say that they are fighters second, and {RELIGION-1,3} first. Out of respect for us as {RELIGION-1,2} nation, the soldiers are willing to join us for a smaller payment than most mercenaries would request.</Translation>

    <Translation>The {FAMILY-1} General {CHARACTER-0} has led your forces to victory. {G0:He:She} is said to be overjoyed at the victory, wishes for public recognition and all but demands it. As insolent as {G0:his:her} behavior is, given our difficult relationship with the {FAMILY-1,1}, honoring {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} could be politically advantageous.</Translation>

    <Translation>With {CITY-0} under attack, {CHARACTER-1} shows that you were right to entrust {G1:him:her} with running {CITY-0}. {CHARACTER-SHORT-1} arrives at the city's link(IMPROVEMENT_BARRACKS) even as fires rage in the city's outskirts and personally guides volunteers willing to defend the city.

We could instruct {CHARACTER-SHORT-1} to hide weapons around the city and prepare the citizens for a battle in the streets, or we could have {G1:him:her} pick the most able volunteers to join the city's defense immediately.</Translation>

    <Translation>Walking among the ruins, your explorers are struck by the carved remnants of what looks like distinctly {RELIGION-2,1} religious art. The site has clearly been abandoned for a long time, since before {RELIGION-2} was known. Is this a mere coincidence, or something much more than that?</Translation>

    <Translation>The palace guard brings a {G0:man:woman} with ragged clothes and a very worn look before you. It's difficult to recognize {CHARACTER-0}, the former general who was last seen fleeing the battlefield as {G0:his:her} men were dying all around.

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0} says {G0:he:she} has come to the court to seek forgiveness. The trials of war and {G0:his:her} personal emotions had clouded {CHARACTER-SHORT-0}'s mind on that occasion, and {G0:he:she} has spent the time since in great shame. Now, {G0:he:she} finally has the courage to face you and beg to be allowed to serve {PLAYER-1} once again.</Translation>

    <Translation>A young woman arrives in {CITY-0}, her appearance leaving no doubt that her journey had been an arduous one. She had been captured by the {TRIBE-1} and languished as a hostage in their camp until she managed to gather an entire group of other hostages and escape with them. They spent several days on the run, until the maiden got to {CITY-0}, even swimming across a river on her journey.

Your own reputation as a refined scholar precedes you, and the link(IMPROVEMENT_LIBRARY_1) will be all the more prestigious if you allow a few works from your own collection to be moved there. What should we make available to the people of {CITY-0} ?</Translation>

    <Translation>Reports abound of the strangest sightings in the sky above {CITY-0}. At daybreak, two red arcs appeared in the sun, followed by blood-red orbs and a variety of rods across the sky. The many shapes started fighting among themselves, flying back and forth for no less than an hour. As the sun grew stronger, the strange shapes burned bright and then faded away, and lastly a large black spear drifted across the sky.

Unbelievable as it sounds, the event was witnessed by many in {CITY-0}, and there is concern that something of great significance has come to pass.</Translation>

As {CHARACTER-2} stands beside you, {G2:he:she} looks uncomfortable in {G2:his:her} ornate governor's robe. Surely {CHARACTER-SHORT-2} could not be worried when it is you who will inspire the masses filling the streets below?

    <Translation>Your spymaster {CHARACTER-0} comes rushing into the throne room, all decorum forgotten, to reveal very important news.

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0} had overheard {CHARACTER-1} plotting to murder you! Even though {CHARACTER-SHORT-1} spoke in code, the meaning did not evade your vigilant spymaster. "Plowing the fields" was code for the assassination itself, and the plotters were careful to only refer to you as "someone". Just hours ago, {CHARACTER-SHORT-1} said "time for dinner", meaning the attempt on your life was imminent!

Not to worry, {CHARACTER-0} took care of the plot personally. {G0:He:She} believes that, for saving you at the last moment, an extra payment is warranted. It is a lot to ask of course, but {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} would like to be named Savior of the Throne. And to have a bowl of fruit.</Translation>

    <Translation>Our ambassador {CHARACTER-1} is known for telling boastful stories, which some in the court have found tiresome but nothing more.

During a recent state dinner with representatives of {PLAYER-0}, {CHARACTER-SHORT-1}'s proclivity for storytelling turned into a diplomatic incident. {G1:He:She} was speaking about serving on the greatest court, with the best advisors and royals, which the {PLAYER-0,3} took to be veiled insults of their own court.
